# Dart CLI Weather App

My Dart CLI App is a tiny command-line weather app written in Dart that allows you to check the weather right from your command line.
It was a fun small task done to test my proffieciency in dart before proceeding to learn flutter.

## Installation

Before using the CLI app, ensure that you have the Dart SDK installed on your system. You can download and install Dart from [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

Once Dart is installed, you can download and install the CLI app by running the following command:

#### 1. Clone the repository to your machine

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/divineamunega/weatherapp-dart.git
```

#### 2. Run the file

```sh
    dart run ./bin/weatherapp.dart --location="Place where you need the weather"
```

The location argument is optional you will still get asked for it when the app is run.
